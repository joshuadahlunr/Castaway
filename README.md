# Castaway: Wizard on a Raft
*Castaway* is a single-player, rouge-like, deck-building card game. You start as a wizard on a basic raft with your goal to survive as long as possible while having to overcome progressively more difficult obstacles the sea puts in your path. Overtime, you can acquire other castaway companions who can be recruited to your crew, granting more cards to our deck. Additionally, after defeating various monstrosities of the sea, you will be able to choose what to do with the remains, being able to allocate these resources to upgrade your ship. Castaway provides an easy-to-learn experience for new players to the deck-building genre but also has replayability allowing veteran players to climb in difficulty and enjoy a challenge.
