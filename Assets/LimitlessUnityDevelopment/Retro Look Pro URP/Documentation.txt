In this example scene you will see how to use Retro Look Pro for UI elements or any other separate layers.
How it works:

0. Make sure that you added "Custom Texture_RLPRO" Render feature to your Renderer.
1. Create Canvas with needed UI elements on layer UI.
2. Create Render Texture.
3. Create separate camera on layer UI to render image to Render Texture.
4. Create post process volume to apply needed effects to UI elements.
5. Create main post process volume.
6. In Volume click "Add Override" RetroLookPro/CustomTexture.
7. Insert previously created Render Texture in "Texture" field.
8. All done! Now you can see your UI elements with effects rendered separately from other elements in scene.

NOTICE: Look at Retro Look Pro render features order in your Renderer. If you want separate layer to be rendered on top of other layers, make sure that "Custom Texture_RLPRO" Render feature is in the bottom of the list.
